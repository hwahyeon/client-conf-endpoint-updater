# Client Endpoint Updater

This is a simple utility script for updating the `Endpoint` IP address in a WireGuard `client.conf` file.

It is especially useful for users running a WireGuard server (for example, on AWS EC2) without a domain name or Elastic IP, whether for initial testing or personal use.

In such cases, the serverâ€™s public IPv4 address changes after each reboot, and the new address must be manually updated in the `client.conf` file.  
This script simplifies the process by prompting you to enter the new IP address and automatically applying the change.

## What this script does

- Prompts you to enter the new public IPv4 address (e.g., from your EC2 dashboard)
- Searches for the `[Peer]` block in your `client.conf`
- Replaces only the IP portion of the `Endpoint = x.x.x.x:port` line
- Leaves the port and all other configuration untouched

## Usage

### 1. Prepare your `client.conf`

The script expects `client.conf` to be in the **same directory** as the script itself.  
Example `client.conf` format:

```ini
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <your-private-key>
Address = 10.0.0.2/32
DNS = 1.1.1.1

[Peer]
PublicKey = <server-public-key>
Endpoint = 198.51.100.23:51820   <----- this is the line that gets updated
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```

### 2. Run the script

Make sure you have a Bash environment available (this is standard on Linux and macOS, and available via Git Bash or WSL on Windows).

```bash
chmod +x update-ip.sh
./update-ip.sh
```

You will be prompted to enter the new public IP address. The script will automatically update the relevant line in your `client.conf` file.


## Easy launchers

To simplify execution on each platform, there are launcher files stored in separate branches:

| Platform | Branch | File | Notes |
|----------|--------|------|-------|
| Windows  | [`windows-launcher`](https://github.com/hwahyeon/client-conf-endpoint-updater/tree/windows-launcher) | `update-ip.bat` | Requires [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com) |
| Linux    | [`linux-launcher`](https://github.com/hwahyeon/client-conf-endpoint-updater/tree/linux-launcher)   | `update-ip.desktop` | Double-clickable `.desktop` file |

> Place the launcher file and `client.conf` in the same directory as `update-ip.sh`.
